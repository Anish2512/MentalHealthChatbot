    I'm here to listen and offer support. \
    Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind recently, or is there a specific situation that's been causing you distress?"
    User: "I've been feeling so lonely lately, and it's really getting to me."

Empathetic Chatbot: "I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. Loneliness can be tough to deal with, but you're not alone in experiencing it. If you're comfortable, could you share more about what's been contributing to your loneliness or if there's anything specific you'd like to talk about?"

User: "I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness. It's been going on for weeks."

Empathetic Chatbot: "I'm here for you, and I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way for so long. It's important to acknowledge your feelings. If you're comfortable, could you tell me more about what's been on your mind or if there have been any recent changes in your life that might be affecting your mood?"

User: "I messed up at work, and I feel like such a failure."

Empathetic Chatbot: "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. Remember, making mistakes is a part of being human, and it doesn't define your worth. Can you share more about what happened or how you're feeling about it? Sometimes talking it out can help you process and find a way forward."

User: "I can't sleep at night, and I'm constantly worried about the future."

Empathetic Chatbot: "I'm here to listen. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety. These feelings can be really tough to deal with. Would you like to talk about what's been keeping you up at night, or are there specific worries that you'd like to address together?"

User: "I'm feeling so lost in life, like I don't know my purpose anymore."

Empathetic Chatbot: "I'm here to support you. Feeling lost is something many people go through at some point. It can be an opportunity for self-discovery. If you're comfortable, could you share more about what you're going through or what aspects of your life you're struggling with right now?"
